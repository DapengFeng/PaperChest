    Previous vision MLPs such as MLP-Mixer and ResMLP accept linearly flattened
    image patches as input, making them inflexible for different input sizes
    and hard to capture spatial information. Such approach withholds MLPs from
    getting comparable performance with their transformer-based counterparts
    and prevents them from becoming a general backbone for computer vision.
    This paper presents Hire-MLP, a simple yet competitive vision MLP
    architecture via Hierarchical rearrangement, which contains two levels of
    rearrangements. Specifically, the inner-region rearrangement is proposed to
    capture local information inside a spatial region, and the cross-region
    rearrangement is proposed to enable information communication between
    different regions and capture global context by circularly shifting all
    tokens along spatial directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
    effectiveness of Hire-MLP as a versatile backbone for various vision tasks.
    In particular, Hire-MLP achieves competitive results on image
    classification, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks, e.g.,
    83.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.7% box AP and 44.8% mask AP on COCO
    val2017, and 49.9% mIoU on ADE20K, surpassing previous transformer-based
    and MLP-based models with better trade-off for accuracy and throughput.

    We present techniques for scaling Swin Transformer [35] up to 3 billion

    1,536x1,536 resolution. By scaling up capacity and resolution, Swin
    Transformer sets new records on four representative vision benchmarks:
    84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet- V2 image classification, 63.1 / 54.4 box
    / mask mAP on COCO object detection, 59.9 mIoU on ADE20K semantic

    classification. We tackle issues of training instability, and study how to
    effectively transfer models pre-trained at low resolutions to higher
    resolution ones. To this aim, several novel technologies are proposed: 1) a
    residual post normalization technique and a scaled cosine attention
    approach to improve the stability of large vision models; 2) a log-spaced
    continuous position bias technique to effectively transfer models
    pre-trained at low-resolution images and windows to their higher-resolution
    counterparts. In addition, we share our crucial implementation details that
    lead to significant savings of GPU memory consumption and thus make it
    feasi-ble to train large vision models with regular GPUs. Using these

    In the field of computer vision, recent works show that a pure MLP
    architecture mainly stacked by fully-connected layers can achieve competing
    performance with CNN and transformer. An input image of vision MLP is
    usually split into multiple tokens (patches), while the existing MLP models
    directly aggregate them with fixed weights, neglecting the varying semantic
    information of tokens from different images. To dynamically aggregate
    tokens, we propose to represent each token as a wave function with two
    parts, amplitude and phase. Amplitude is the original feature and the phase
    term is a complex value changing according to the semantic contents of
    input images. Introducing the phase term can dynamically modulate the
    relationship between tokens and fixed weights in MLP. Based on the
    wave-like token representation, we establish a novel Wave-MLP architecture
    for vision tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
    Wave-MLP is superior to the state-of-the-art MLP architectures on various
    vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic
    segmentation. The source code is available at

    Detecting oriented and densely packed objects remains challenging for
    spatial feature aliasing caused by the intersection of reception fields
    between objects. In this paper, we propose a convex-hull feature adaptation
    (CFA) approach for configuring convolutional features in accordance with
    oriented and densely packed object layouts. CFA is rooted in convex-hull
    feature representation, which defines a set of dynamically predicted
    feature points guided by the convex intersection over union (CIoU) to bound
    the extent of objects. CFA pursues optimal feature assignment by
    constructing convex-hull sets and dynamically splitting positive or
    negative convex-hulls. By simultaneously considering overlapping
    convex-hulls and objects and penalizing convex-hulls shared by multiple
    objects, CFA alleviates spatial feature aliasing towards optimal feature
    adaptation. Experiments on DOTA and SKU110K-R datasets show that CFA
    significantly outperforms the baseline approach, achieving new

    This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that
    capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision.
    Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from
    differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale
    of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to
    words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical
    Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The
    shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting
    self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also
    allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has
    the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational
    complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer
    make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image
    classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction
    tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO
    test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its
    performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of
    +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K,
    demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision
    backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also
    prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures. The code and models are
    publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer.

    Boundary discontinuity and its inconsistency to the final detection metric
    have been the bottleneck for rotating detection regression loss design. In
    this paper, we propose a novel regression loss based on Gaussian
    Wasserstein distance as a fundamental approach to solve the problem.
    Specifically, the rotated bounding box is converted to a 2-D Gaussian
    distribution, which enables to approximate the indifferentiable rotational
    IoU induced loss by the Gaussian Wasserstein distance (GWD) which can be
    learned efficiently by gradient back-propagation. GWD can still be
    informative for learning even there is no overlapping between two rotating
    bounding boxes which is often the case for small object detection. Thanks
    to its three unique properties, GWD can also elegantly solve the boundary
    discontinuity and square-like problem regardless how the bounding box is
    defined. Experiments on five datasets using different detectors show the
    effectiveness of our approach, and codes are available at

    One of the main challenges for arbitrary-shaped text detection is to design
    a good text instance representation that allows networks to learn diverse
    text geometry variances. Most of existing methods model text instances in
    image spatial domain via masks or contour point sequences in the Cartesian
    or the polar coordinate system. However, the mask representation might lead
    to expensive post-processing, while the point sequence one may have limited
    capability to model texts with highly-curved shapes. To tackle these
    problems, we model text instances in the Fourier domain and propose one
    novel Fourier Contour Embedding (FCE) method to represent arbitrary shaped
    text contours as compact signatures. We further construct FCENet with a
    backbone, feature pyramid networks (FP-N) and a simple post-processing with
    the Inverse Fourier Transformation (IFT) and Non-Maximum Suppression
    (N-MS). Different from previous methods, FCENet first pre-dicts compact
    Fourier signatures of text instances, and then reconstructs text contours
    via IFT and NMS during test. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FCE is
    accurate and robust to fit contours of scene texts even with highly-curved
    shapes, and also validate the effectiveness and the good generalization of
    FCENet for arbitrary-shaped text detection. Furthermore, experimental
    results show that our FCENet is superior to the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
    meth-ods on CTW1500 and Total-Text, especially on challenging highly-curved
    text subset.

    Modern object detectors rely heavily on rectangular bounding boxes, such as
    anchors, proposals and the final predictions, to represent objects at
    various recognition stages. The bounding box is convenient to use but
    provides only a coarse localization of objects and leads to a
    correspondingly coarse extraction of object features. In this paper, we
    present RepPoints (representative points), a new finer representation of
    objects as a set of sample points useful for both localization and
    recognition. Given ground truth localization and recognition targets for
    training, RepPoints learn to automatically arrange themselves in a manner
    that bounds the spatial extent of an object and indicates semantically
    significant local areas. They furthermore do not require the use of anchors
    to sample a space of bounding boxes. We show that an anchor-free object
    detector based on RepPoints can be as effective as the state-of-the-art
    anchor-based detection methods, with 46.5 AP and 67.4 AP50 on the COCO

    Feature pyramids are a basic component in recognition systems for detecting
    objects at different scales. But pyramid representations have been avoided
    in recent object detectors that are based on deep convolutional networks,
    partially because they are slow to compute and memory intensive. In this
    paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep
    convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra
    cost. A top-down architecture with lateral connections is developed for
    building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture,
    called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a
    generic feature extractor in several applications. Using a basic Faster
    R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art single-model results on
    the COCO detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all
    existing single-model entries including those from the COCO 2016 challenge
    winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a
    practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will
