    Space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), as an integration of satellite
    systems, aerial networks, and terrestrial communications, has been becoming
    an emerging architecture and attracted intensive research interest during
    the past years. Besides bringing significant benefits for various practical
    services and applications, SAGIN is also facing many unprecedented
    challenges due to its specific characteristics, such as heterogeneity,
    self-organization, and time-variability. Compared to traditional ground or
    satellite networks, SAGIN is affected by the limited and unbalanced network
    resources in all three network segments, so that it is difficult to obtain
    the best performances for traffic delivery. Therefore, the system
    integration, protocol optimization, resource management, and allocation in
    SAGIN is of great significance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
    first to present the state-of-the-art of the SAGIN since existing survey
    papers focused on either only one single network segment in space or air,
    or the integration of space-ground, neglecting the integration of all the
    three network segments. In light of this, we present in this paper a
    comprehensive review of recent research works concerning SAGIN from network
    design and resource allocation to performance analysis and optimization.
    After discussing several existing network architectures, we also point out
    some technology challenges and future directions.
