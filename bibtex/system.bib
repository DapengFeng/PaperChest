    Aerial robots are widely deployed, but highly cluttered environments such
    as dense forests remain inaccessible to drones and even more so to swarms
    of drones. In these scenarios, previously unknown surroundings and narrow
    corridors combined with requirements of swarm coordination can create
    challenges. To enable swarm navigation in the wild, we develop miniature
    but fully autonomous drones with a trajectory planner that can function in
    a timely and accurate manner based on limited information from onboard
    sensors. The planning problem satisfies various task requirements including
    flight efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance,
    dynamical feasibility, swarm coordination, and so on, thus realizing an
    extensible planner. Furthermore, the proposed planner deforms trajectory
    shapes and adjusts time allocation synchronously based on spatial-temporal
    joint optimization. A high-quality trajectory thus can be obtained after
    exhaustively exploiting the solution space within only a few milliseconds,
    even in the most constrained environment. The planner is finally integrated
    into the developed palm-sized swarm platform with onboard perception,
    localization, and control. Benchmark comparisons validate the superior
    performance of the planner in trajectory quality and computing time.
    Various real-world field experiments demonstrate the extensibility of our
    system. Our approach evolves aerial robotics in three aspects: capability
    of cluttered environment navigation, extensibility to diverse task
    requirements, and coordination as a swarm without external facilities. A
    fully autonomous swarm composed of palm-sized drones with versatile task
    extensibility in the wild is realized.

    We present an open-source toolbox, named MMRotate, which provides a
    coherent algorithm framework of training, inferring, and evaluation for the
    popular rotated object detection algorithm based on deep learning. MMRotate
    implements 18 state-of-the-art algorithms and supports the three most
    frequently used angle definition methods. To facilitate future research and
    industrial applications of rotated object detection-related problems, we
    also provide a large number of trained models and detailed benchmarks to
    give insights into the performance of rotated object detection. MMRotate is
    publicly released at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate.
