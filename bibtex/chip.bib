    Deep learning uses multilayered artificial neural networks to learn
    digitally from large datasets. It then performs advanced identification and
    classification tasks. To date, these multilayered neural networks have been
    implemented on a computer. Lin et al. demonstrate all-optical machine
    learning that uses passive optical components that can be patterned and
    fabricated with 3D-printing. Their hardware approach comprises stacked
    layers of diffractive optical elements analogous to an artificial neural
    network that can be trained to execute complex functions at the speed of
    light. Science, this issue p. 1004 All-optical deep learning can be
    implemented with 3D-printed passive optical components. Deep learning has
    been transforming our ability to execute advanced inference tasks using
    computers. Here we introduce a physical mechanism to perform machine
    learning by demonstrating an all-optical diffractive deep neural network
    (D2NN) architecture that can implement various functions following the deep
    learningâ€“based design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively.
    We created 3D-printed D2NNs that implement classification of images of
    handwritten digits and fashion products, as well as the function of an
    imaging lens at a terahertz spectrum. Our all-optical deep learning
    framework can perform, at the speed of light, various complex functions
    that computer-based neural networks can execute; will find applications in
    all-optical image analysis, feature detection, and object classification;
    and will also enable new camera designs and optical components that perform
    distinctive tasks using D2NNs.
