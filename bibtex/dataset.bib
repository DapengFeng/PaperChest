    In he past decade, object detection has achieved significant progress in
    natural images but not in aerial images, due to the massive variations in
    the scale and orientation of objects caused by the bird’s-eye view of
    aerial images. More importantly, the lack of large-scale benchmarks has
    become a major obstacle to the development of object detection in aerial
    images (ODAI). In this paper, we present a large-scale Dataset of Object
    deTection in Aerial images (DOTA) and comprehensive baselines for ODAI. The
    proposed DOTA dataset contains 1,793,658 object instances of 18 categories
    of oriented-bounding-box annotations collected from 11,268 aerial images.
    Based on this large-scale and well-annotated dataset, we build baselines
    covering 10 state-of-the-art algorithms with over 70 configurations, where
    the speed and accuracy performances of each model have been evaluated.
    Furthermore, we provide a code library for ODAI and build a website for
    evaluating different algorithms. Previous challenges run on DOTA have
    attracted more than 1300 teams worldwide. We believe that the expanded
    large-scale DOTA dataset, the extensive baselines, the code library and the
    challenges can facilitate the designs of robust algorithms and reproducible
    research on the problem of object detection in aerial images.

    Object detection is an important and challenging problem in computer
    vision. Although the past decade has witnessed major advances in object
    detection in natural scenes, such successes have been slow to aerial
    imagery, not only because of the huge variation in the scale, orientation
    and shape of the object instances on the earth's surface, but also due to
    the scarcity of well-annotated datasets of objects in aerial scenes. To
    advance object detection research in Earth Vision, also known as Earth
    Observation and Remote Sensing, we introduce a large-scale Dataset for
    Object deTection in Aerial images (DOTA). To this end, we collect 2806
    aerial images from different sensors and platforms. Each image is of the
    size about 4000 × 4000 pixels and contains objects exhibiting a wide
    variety of scales, orientations, and shapes. These DOTA images are then
    annotated by experts in aerial image interpretation using 15 common object
    categories. The fully annotated DOTA images contains 188, 282 instances,
    each of which is labeled by an arbitrary (8 d.o.f.) quadrilateral. To build
    a baseline for object detection in Earth Vision, we evaluate
    state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on DOTA. Experiments
    demonstrate that DOTA well represents real Earth Vision applications and
    are quite challenging.
